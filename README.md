## Content

The content of this DUNE module has been extracted from the module `dumux`.
In particular, the following subfolders of `dumux` have been extracted:
*   `examples`

Additionally, all headers inÂ `dumux` that are required to build the
executables from the sources
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/1protationsymmetry/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/2pinfiltration/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/1ptracer/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/liddrivencavity/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/freeflowchannel/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/biomineralization/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/shallowwaterfriction/main.cc`
*   `/Users/ouetsu/dumuxday/dumux/examples/porenetwork_upscaling/main.cc`

have been extracted. You can configure the module just like any other DUNE
module by using `dunecontrol`. For building and running the executables,
please go to the build folders corresponding to the sources listed above.

## Installation

The installation procedure is done as follows :
Create a root folder, e.g. `DUMUX`, enter the previously created folder,
clone the remote and use the install script `install_dumux-test.py`
provided in this repository to install all dependent modules.

```sh
mkdir DUMUX
cd DUMUX
git clone git@github.com:tkdxwb/testpy.git
python3 dumux-test/install_dumux-test.py
```

This will clone all modules into the directory `DUMUX`,
configure your module with `dunecontrol` and build tests.
